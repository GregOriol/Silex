**WARNING**: This repository is a fork of [Silex](https://github.com/silexphp/Silex). While the original one is not maintained anymore and has been declared "end of life" in June 2018, this repository has been put up to date with Symfony 4.x (see branch) and 5.x (master) components.

Silex, a simple Web Framework
=============================

Silex is a PHP micro-framework to develop websites based on [Symfony components](https://symfony.com):

``` {.sourceCode .php}
<?php

require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new Silex\Application();

$app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) {
  return 'Hello '.$app->escape($name);
});

$app->run();
```

The current master works with PHP 7.2.5 or later, and Symfony 5.x.
